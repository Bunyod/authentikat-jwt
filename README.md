authentikat-jwt
===============

Authentikat JWT is a JSON Web Token Draft Implementation for Scala.
At the time of writing, it is incomplete.
I suspect it will be in usable state end of April, 2013.
It will be part of a larger security solution (planned name is Authentikat) that can be used as an authentication server
in a distributed application environment.

Motivations
-----------

The motivation for the creation of the authentikat project is that in small side projects, the initial rush of
motivation is often taken up in bootstrap efforts. I'd like something I can check out, turn on, and use for auth in a
distributed manner.

I will write an article describing JWT and some of its potential uses shortly.
