authentikat-jwt
===============

Authentikat-jwt is a JSON Web Token draft implementation for Scala.
It is in a usable state but should be considered experimental with no stability in the API. 
I suspect it will be in stable state (eg 1.0.0) end of April, 2014.
It will be part of a larger security solution (planned name is Authentikat) that can be used as an authentication server in a distributed application environment.

Motivations
-----------

The motivation for the creation of the authentikat project is that in small side projects, the initial rush of
motivation is often taken up in bootstrap efforts. I'd like something I can check out, turn on, and use for auth in a
distributed manner.

JWT
---

I will write an article describing JWT and some of its potential uses shortly.
